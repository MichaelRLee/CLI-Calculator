<h3>Flaws in documentaion:</h3>
<p>
The code I selected was used as a repository for a McMaster student's assignment in the course 2S03: Principles of programming. The reason I selected it was not becuase there weren't enough comments, but too many comments, every single line of the code had a comment. This is a crucial flaw in the code because it leads to irrelevant comments that the programmer should already know. The actual code will then become more difficult to read with all the comments in the way. This code covers a very complex/unusual approach to calculating mathematics BEDMASS operations, the multiple comments increase this codes complexity making it difficult to read and understand. A key to creating good comments is to make them as clear and concise as possible which was clearly not followed in this assignment.
